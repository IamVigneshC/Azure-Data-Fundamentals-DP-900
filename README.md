- Predictive analytics is what it sounds like — it aims to predict likely outcomes and make educated forecasts using historical data 
- Prescriptive analytics uses the data from a variety of sources — including statistics, machine learning, and data mining — to identify possible future outcomes and show the best option
- Diagnostics analytics identifies trends or patterns in the past and then goes a step further to explain why the trends occurred the way they did


- Normalization is the process of **organizing data** in a database. This includes creating tables and **establishing relationships** between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by **eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency**.
