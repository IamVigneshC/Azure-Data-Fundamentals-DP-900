Descriptive analytics examines what happened in the past. 
Predictive analytics is what it sounds like — it aims to predict likely outcomes and make educated forecasts using historical data. 
Prescriptive analytics uses the data from a variety of sources — including statistics, machine learning, and data mining — to identify possible future outcomes and show the best option. 
Diagnostics analytics identifies trends or patterns in the past and then goes a step further to explain why the trends occurred the way they did.
